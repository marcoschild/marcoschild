Welcome to my GitHub profile.

I'm **Marco**, a 19-year-old developer and researcher from Zurich, working at the intersection of **AI**, **quantum computing**, and **human impact**. I create systems that blend mathematics, intelligence, and compassion — from neural network frameworks to charity-oriented tech platforms.

## 🧠 What I Focus On

- **Quantum-Classical Architectures**  
  Creating hybrid models that combine quantum logic gates with neural computation.

- **AI for Social Good**  
  Building AI platforms that help underserved populations — from shelter-matching systems to foodbank assistants.

- **Minimalist Machine Learning**  
  Building from scratch — autodiff engines, neural networks, and symbolic AI that prioritizes clarity.

- **Research & System Design**  
  Writing PhD-level research papers on the role of quantum computing in medicine, cognition, and beyond.

## 🚀 Notable Projects

### 🌌 [`nanoquant`](https://github.com/marcoschild/nanoquant)
A minimalist neural network framework with native quantum gate simulation support. Think of it as PyTorch + Qiskit distilled into something readable, educational, and hackable.

### 🛡️ AI-Powered Cybersecurity
A custom platform for detecting phishing, malware, and anomalies using lightweight deep learning models and human behavior modeling.

### 🧭 Charity Infrastructure Toolkit
An AI-powered tool to assist nonprofits and city shelters in connecting people to food, warmth, and work.
